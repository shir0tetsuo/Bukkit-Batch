LANC 2
======

Making a LANCX Server
------
Run the LANCChannelMaker and follow the instructions.
Copy the LANCX folder to the desired (server) path.

Getting Started
------

The LANC kit is simple to use.
Clone the LANC folder to your computer.

Open the **LANCIn2.bat** program.
Follow the instructions on screen, or skip them and press enter.
Run the Configure tool.
Enter the full path of the LANCX folder.
If the LANCX folder is in a UNC location, ignore the 404 messages and run pushload.
To specify a temporary UNC location, run pushd. The full LANCX location must be specified.

Once you've found the LANCX server, the warnings will disappear.

    If the LANCX server is in a non-UNC location, for example dropbox, type Load to quickly load the location data.
    If the LANCX server is in a UNC location, run pushload.

Once the loc.dat file has been created, you will be able to quickly load the configuration according to location.

Follow the instructions on screen after loading. Note that the login function will be disabled until the LANCX server is detected.

Encrypting Chats
------

Make an orom-x#.txt file, # for channel number.
Store the password inside.
