RUNBUKK-version.bat: Bukkit Server Starter

    Scattershot Updater (WIP)
	The Scattershot branch has its own unique key that will automatically detect when files are updated.

	Expected in 7.7 (7.7.0b#/a1):
    - Settings file will be expanded to seven lines for on off switches, coming with the well anticipated Map Loading Utility 1.0.
    - OPTIONS Section to turn on a splash screen / menu skipper.
    - BACKUP Section: Backup your world.
    - Purgelog will include timestamps (eg server.log.old)
    - Purgelog will save logs in a separate folder
